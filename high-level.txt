0a. Disable compute node from taking new instances
0b. Backup Galera DB
1. On a compute node, modify the firewall_driver from openvswitch to iptables_hybrid in ml2_conf.ini and openvswitch_agent.ini
2. Find all ports on a given compute node whose ['binding:vif_details']['ovs_hybrid_plug'] is False
3. Using the returned port IDs, remove the respective tap interface from the integration bridge
4. For every port, update the 'ml2_port_bindings' table and modify 'vif_details' field changing 'ovs_hybrid_plug' from 'false' to 'true'
5. Restart neutron-openvswitch-agent
6. Restart nova-compute
7. Verify qbr, qvb and qvo interfaces are created
8. Iterate through the orphaned taps and put them in their respective bridge
9. Enable compute node to take new instances
